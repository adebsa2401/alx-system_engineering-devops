========================================================

As a part of our curriculum at ALX Africa, I have built a video streaming application with two partners: Pericles A. and Mikiyas D. Let me showcase you everything you need to know about this.

Purpose of the project
======================

The problem is a simple remark : Streaming services are not free, maybe for commercial purposes or other stuff but the fact is "They are expensive for people with less money". So the question remaining was how to give free access of those libraries to people ?

Highlight on participants
=========================

Team
====

-   **Pericles Adjovi**

**main role:** Backend developer

**reason:** He chose to focus his skills into the implementation of the business logic

of the application in order to strengthen his backend development skills but

he also wants to proceed to the UI realization.

-   **Arsene Awounou**

**main role:** Frontend developer

**reason:** chose to mainly work on the Front-end part because it is the first part any visitors will be interacting with when visiting our application. He also want to

improve his Front-end skills and make it through new challenges. Though

He will be working with the backend developer.

-   **Mikiyas Eyob**

**main role:** Frontend developer

**reason:** He wants to focus on the frontend but also want to play a role in the backend

The reason i want Front end development is because the only form of

development that the user will actually see is front-end. Every optimization or

decision you make actually matters. But also i want to participate in the

back-end development too.

Interest of the project
=======================

The interest of this project is to let people with geeky tastes to entertain theirselves using our application. It takes more sense since common streaming applications don't have a particular category for geeks.

Personal focus
==============

I personally focused on working about the backend part of the application :

Doing the server and implementing the routes that should be connected to the frontend .

Technical assets
================

-   Tools

Git , Github, Nginx web server, .tech domain

-   Hardware

Linux OS

-   Books

Design patterns book

-   Languages

Javascript

-   Libraries

Reactjs, redux

-   Frameworks

Express (nodejs)

Justification about framework choice
------------------------------------

Choosing the framework to use for this project has been a real struggle. In fact, we have been confronted with a comparison between Django REST framework and Flask framework.

The first one is a great and powerful tool given to developers in order to create API that communicate with their user interfaces while the second is a small micro framework more simple and easier to take in hand to develop complete web applications or API.

We definitely have choosen Flask because it is the main framework we use in the holberton curriculum.

Results & screenshots
=====================

Here are some screenshots of the diagrams and final layout of the application.
